# Query-String-Encryption
Simple MVC 4.5 Solution which shows how to Easily encrypt query strings pass them to another page and then Decrypt them. 


Basically just putting together some simple encryption to pass object as JSON around from 2 different systems.   I did not write the Encryption 
Methods but merely are using them.   

Start Project: 
    Opens up a Form to enter information into it.   
    Press Submit, The Form data is Encrypted and passed to another view through a Qstring. 
    The Qstring is Decrypted and Cast back to the Originating object type. 
    The data is displayed on the new page.  
    
    **The CryptoObj is merely a working example and probably not ideal for real world.
